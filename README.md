# BondBank

This is a defi project that will use ERC1155 to issue ETFs/Bonds to investors

Motivation: For unsophisticated investors, there are very limited ways to gain exposure to various defi protocols. This projects aims to make this process simple by offering investors a financial instrument (ERC1155 token) that provides that exposure to the market.
